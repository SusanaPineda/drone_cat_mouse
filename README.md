# Juego del gato y el rat√≥n
In the following documents are the steps followed to implement a cat drone that automatically chases a JdeRobot mouse drone.

## The problem
In this case, it is intended to implement the logic that allows a cat drone to automatically chase a second drone, mouse drone.

For this implementation we have the image of two cameras located on the front and bottom of the drone-cat. Drone drift is controlled by the variables vx, vy, vz, and az, where vx, vy, and vz control the linear velocity at x, and and z and az represent the angular velocity of the drone.
